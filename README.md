## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create and implement an app that can track the temperature of people visiting and living in a "care home" and store this information in a database. This information can then be accessed as necessary and used as a preventative measure against COVID-19.

## Technical Aspects

The general working of this app aims to do the following:

1. Accept visitor details and temperature measurements and store this in a database.
2. Accept resident details and temperature measurements and store this in a database.
3. Provide registration services for new residents and visitors.
4. Visitors history and daily log of visitors to specific residents.
5. Provide a report form in the event that someone becomes unwell after visting a care home.
